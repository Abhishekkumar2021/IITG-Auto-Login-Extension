The `README.md` file generally contains important information about a project. Depending how your project is set up, the
contents of your README might include:

- A project title.
- A description of what the project does.
- How to install dependencies and get the project running.
- How to use the project.
- Any contribution guidelines.
- Any code examples that are needed to understand the project.
- Licensing information.

Here's a basic example:

```markdown
# Project Title

This is a short description of what the project does.

## Installation

Provide code blocks and explanations for how to get the project installed.

```sh
$ npm install projectName
```

## Usage

Provide examples and/or code blocks for how to use the project.

```sh
$ projectName --help
```

## Contributing

Details about how to contribute to the project.

## License

Information about the license the project uses.

```

Note: This is just a basic structure, not all README files need to contain all these sections. Customize it to suit your project's needs. Since you mentioned not to wrap the code in a code fence, I've used the ``` character at the start and end of any code blocks.
